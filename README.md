#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- Writing programs that are mintainable, readable, and adaptable is key to becoming a successful developer. It will not only make the life easier for yourself as a developer, but will make it easier for future developers to be able to read and maintain the program. Whether the code is being used in the future or not, it is important to get into this type of habit.
- The advantages of connecting a dashboard widget, such as CRUD using Python, to a database is allowing the program to allow the addition of new capabilities and functionality. This allows the architecture to be designed to accommodate changes easily. I can use this method in the future for other projects. 
#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
